# Car_prediction_analysis
This project aims to predict car prices using a dataset from Quikr, which includes various features such as the car's brand, manufacturing year, kilometers driven, and fuel type. The analysis involves data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

**Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a car based on its features. By understanding the factors that influence car prices, we can provide valuable insights to potential buyers and sellers in the used car market.
